# Detection Name: AWS SSO Device Code Phishing

description: |
  The threat described in the summarized intelligence is a phishing attack that exploits the device code authentication feature in AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO). Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to steal AWS credentials from users, even if they have enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) or IP allow-listing at the identity provider (IdP) level.
  
  The device code authentication flow in AWS SSO, similar to other OpenID Connect-based IdPs, allows users to authenticate by entering a code displayed on their device into the AWS SSO console. Attackers can create a phishing page that mimics the legitimate AWS SSO login flow and intercept the device code, allowing them to gain access to the user's AWS account.
  
  This attack is particularly dangerous as it can bypass common security controls like MFA and IP restrictions, rendering them ineffective.
