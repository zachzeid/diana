# Detection Name: AWS SSO Device Code Phishing

description: |
  The threat described in the summarized intelligence is a phishing attack that targets AWS SSO (Single Sign-On) users by exploiting the device code authentication feature. This feature, which is part of the OpenID Connect protocol, allows users to authenticate by entering a code displayed on their device. The attack works by tricking the user into entering their credentials on a malicious website that mimics the legitimate AWS SSO login page, effectively stealing their credentials.

This attack is particularly dangerous because it can bypass security controls like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and IP allowlisting at the identity provider (IdP) level. By stealing the user's credentials, the attacker can gain access to the user's AWS accounts and perform malicious activities.
